I want to express my gratitude to the {\em eScience} group that I was allowed to be a part of. Also, I am very grateful for Asst. Prof {\em Kenneth Skovhede} provided an open environment where I felt heard and supported. Further, I want to thank the members of the SME group who were always available to answer all of my questions, give me their feedback and inspire me during my time in the group. 
\\

Mainly, I want to thank {\em Carl-Johannes Johnsen} for the strong support during the work of my thesis. Without his insight, help, and encouragement, the goal of this project would not have been fulfilled.\\

Finally, I want to {\em thank Nam Tran} for being a great support throughout my studies and all of my friends who have read this thesis and made suggestions for improvements. Additionally, thanks to {\em Niklas Heim} and {\em Fabian Dornhecker} for letting me use this visually appealing template.
